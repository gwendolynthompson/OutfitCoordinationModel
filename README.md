# Outfit Coordination Model
This is for my deep learning final project. I will be working to create a model that can assess if various pieces match in order to create an outfit. I will be using this data: https://github.com/xthan/polyvore-dataset?tab=readme-ov-file along with this model: https://huggingface.co/microsoft/resnet-50
